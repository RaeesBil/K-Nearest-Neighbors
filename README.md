K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the 'k' closest data points (neighbors) to a given input and assigning the most common class label (for classification) or averaging their values (for regression). KNN is simple, yet effective, and does not require an explicit training phase. However, it can be computationally expensive for large datasets, as predictions require calculating distances to all training points.

This dataset contains demographic and work-related attributes, such as age, workclass, education, occupation, gender, capital-gain, and more, with the target variable being income (whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold). By applying KNN, we can classify individuals into income brackets based on their demographic and occupational attributes. The goal is to predict whether a person earns more or less than the given income threshold based on factors like education, occupation, and hours worked per week.
